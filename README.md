Pixel manipulation for image encryption

This program allows users to encrypt an image by shifting the RGB values of each pixel by a specified key and save the encrypted image. Similarly, it enables users to decrypt the encrypted image by shifting the RGB values of each pixel back using the same key, resulting in the original image.
